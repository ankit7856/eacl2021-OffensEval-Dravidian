### Notes
- Except for code, other things (like pretrained models, submission files and checkpoints) can be downloaded from this [drive repo](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xnQ63uZ7Pq1go1K21OkgRkGFUkfizoT7?usp=sharing).
- The scripts for creating these pretrained models are placed at [./pretraining](./pretraining)
- See [./code/datasets/eacl2021](./code/datasets/eacl2021) for creating data and running code. However, the main scripts are located in [code/scripts](.code/scripts) folder.
- The .ipynb files (colab files) use absolute paths. So be careful and please change them according to your local directory path(s).
- See [./code/datasets/eacl2021/run.sh](./code/datasets/eacl2021/run.sh) for how to run the code. Alternatively, see notebooks in [./colab_notebooks](./colab_notebooks)
