# EACL 2021 OffensEval in Dravidian Languages

- Except for code, other things (like pretrained models, submission files) can be downloaded from this [drive repo](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xnQ63uZ7Pq1go1K21OkgRkGFUkfizoT7?usp=sharing).
- The scripts for creating these pretrained models are placed at [./pretraining](./pretraining)
- See [./code/datasets/eacl2021](./code/datasets/eacl2021) for creating data and running code. However, the main scripts are located in [code/scripts](.code/scripts) folder.
- The .ipynb files placed in this folder use absolute paths. So be careful and please change them according to your path(s).

- Note: Several snippets of code are derived from Sai's Capstone Project
